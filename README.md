# OurITProject gh-pages
<p>The website of our group page uses simple HTML, and CSS code to show our report simply. It shows a report on Our IT Project, Assignment 3. With CSS we style our website with a background image, a banner of the COSC2083 course on the top that we can click to go to the Canvas course site, including a table of contents that can get to the right part after clicking on the title and it always stick to the left of the pages so that we can easily go to the part that we want when we scrolling down. With Javascript, I coded a function for the button that can show more sub-pages in the team profile and project description.</p>

<p>Git has facilitated our process to build the website, we easy to maintain and control the version of our website code. Based on the git log we can see that our process work was very well, It helped us to check others' progress quickly when working on the group project, and submit our work easily. Everyone has contributed their part by pushing it onto the GitHub repository. After finishing the assigned task, we use git to push our work onto the git repository and create a pull request, so that the team leader can check and merge the work into the main branch.</p>
