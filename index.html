            <p>My name is Tong Thien Phuoc, s4010791. I'm a student at RMIT University Vietnam, My interest in the Computer Science field started when I was just a high school student. I started learning how to program with C. This was a wise choice for me at the very beginning, With C I not only learned to program but also learned how the computer works underneath the hood. With a little knowledge of C programming, I was very excited to find some courses that helped me to build a strong foundation, and CS50 of Prof. David J Manlan appeared to me to get introduced to Computer Science. Along my journey to discover things about technology, I was fascinated by a field of Computer Science which is Artificial Intelligence, due to the great things that computers can do without explicit programs. With my curiosity for Artificial Intelligence particularly machine learning, I have been finding out how a model is built and learning how to build a model from scratch, for example, I can build a machine learning model to classify images with a simple neural network structure. Every time I learn new things, I always discover some new problems, for example After I can successfully train a machine learning model how can I integrate it into an application for the community to use, that is why I want to learn how to make a mobile and web application, and now I have experience at building web, a mobile application that help me a lot to intergrate the machine learning model that I develop. I am very enjoying learning about technology, all the things that I have learned have helped me a lot in my learning journey and given me a good foundation knowledge for this field. I have some experience in building web applications with Reactjs, and machine learning with Tensorflow, and Keras. Now I'm currently a coding teacher at Brightchamps organization. The Ideal Job for me in the future may be an AI engineer position, at this position I can do things about Artificial Intelligence that I love to do.</p>
