                <article>My name is Tong Thien Phuoc, s4010791. I'm a student at RMIT University Vietnam, My interest in the Computer Science field started when I was just a high school student. I started learning how to program with C. This was a wise choice for me at the very beginning, With C I not only learned to program but also learned how the computer works underneath the hood. With a little knowledge of C programming, I was very excited to find some courses that helped me to build a strong foundation, and CS50 of Prof. David J Manlan appeared to me to get introduced to Computer Science. Along my journey to discover things about technology, I was fascinated by a field of Computer Science which is Artificial Intelligence, due to the great things that computers can do without explicit programs. With my curiosity for Artificial Intelligence particularly machine learning, I have been finding out how a model is built and learning how to build a model from scratch, for example, I can build a machine learning model to classify images with a simple neural network structure. Every time I learn new things, I always discover some new problems, for example After I can successfully train a machine learning model how can I integrate it into an application for the community to use, that is why I want to learn how to make a mobile and web application, and now I have experience at building web, a mobile application that help me a lot to intergrate the machine learning model that I develop. I am very enjoying learning about technology, all the things that I have learned have helped me a lot in my learning journey and given me a good foundation knowledge for this field. I have some experience in building web applications with Reactjs, and machine learning with Tensorflow, and Keras. Now I'm currently a coding teacher at Brightchamps organization. The Ideal Job for me in the future may be an AI engineer position, at this position I can do things about Artificial Intelligence that I love to do.</article>

                <article>My name: Đỗ Thành Tín. s3970879. I truly like being able to build software or websites that can help people in various ways. The most significant field in which I've shown the greatest interest thus far is artificial intelligence. In addition to learning about the information technology sector, I also pay close attention to health concerns, sports training, and playing sports, such as football, or exchanging new information with others about other facets of life in my free time. John McAfee is the individual whose accomplishments and contribution to humanity as a whole I find to be most impressive. He makes things that are both innovative and cutting edge.</article>

                <p>The system will be designed to visualize skin lesions and extract important details including color, texture and shape. Matchable properties are then found by comparing these properties with an extensive database of skin diseases known to exist. The system will be trained to detect patterns and make accurate predictions based on input data using machine learning. As a result, the system should be able to generate a list of potential diagnoses along with pertinent data and suggest therapy.</p>
                <p>For early detection of skin diseases and treatment, skin diseases must be applied to clinical practice. Making the right treatment decision for a patient depends on an accurate and prompt diagnosis. However, a wide range of skin problems and similarities in appearance make it difficult to understand skin conditions. Therefore, the goal of our project is to develop a reliable tool that can help dermatologists make informed choices.</p>
                <p>Our solution will help reduce stress on dermatologists and increase the overall efficiency of healthcare delivery by automating the analysis and detection of skin problems. Strong. In addition, it will be a useful resource for medical practitioners in isolated or hard-to-reach locations where a dermatologist's accessibility may be limited. Overall, the use of skin pathology in our project has the potential to radically transform dermatology practice and dramatically enhance patient care.</p>

               <p>The idea to build an application that will help people detect skin diseases people suffer from came to me a long time ago. The application aims to help people know about their condition to prevent potential consequences of skin diseases. The motivation for this project is that I realize many people are suffering from skin diseases that could potentially cause harmful impacts on their health, but they are not aware of that. For example, I'm one of them, I suffered from a strange skin disease that caused me a sudden hearing loss in my left ear just because I was not aware of its potential consequences. And this makes me want to make a product to help people, based on the symptoms of the skin application will provide information about the treatment of different conditions, their skin condition, what they suffer from, what it may cause to their health, how to prevent it in the future, and what needs to be aware of. The application helps people to detect their skin condition simply by taking a picture of the suffering skin and algorithms to detect the disease. To make this idea work in code, the power of machine learning came to me, more specifically computer vision, nowadays the rise of AI and its application is in a very wide range in many fields, and utilizing its capability is a great way to improve the performance of our product. To make this easy for people to use and save labor, I think of React Native as the framework we will use to develop an application for many platforms, from iOS to Android OS, this helps people easily download and use on any platform. The plan to develop is divided into two main parts, develop the machine learning model and develop the application to deploy the model in the product.</p>
               <p>The most difficult part is developing the machine learning model. With this, we encountered many problems, such as finding the best approach, collecting data, and preprocessing the data. This is the part that we will spend most of our time on, We had made many changes to our approach before coming to the final decision due to our current ability, and the data set that we can collect. There are multiple parts to developing a model that works well on our given task.</p>
               <p>First, to develop a model that can detect skin conditions precisely our primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying skin disease images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is a neural network architecture that is very effective in image classification, is our best approach. With the help of the community, we can use transfer learning and fine-tuning, a technique that involves taking a pre-trained neural network and replacing the output layer to classify the skin disease image, which means it will be easier and more efficient for the model to learn from data features than learn from scratch. This approach is very effective in our case due to the complexity of our data set which is images of skin, and facilitates our progress in developing the machine learning model. Choosing an architect for our neural network that is large enough to train and effectively classify images is the first part that we have done on our model. With the chosen architecture and transfer learning method this is what we will work on, a pre-trained model VGG-16, a standard CNN architecture with multiple layers. To accomplish this we use Keras, a popular deep-learning library that provides an application interface for loading and using pre-trained models.</p>
               <p>Second, collecting data was the most difficult part that we encountered in the progress of this project. Finding large enough images about skin disease is not an easy task, After finding many resources we luckily found a data set of Dermnet, a free dermatology resource website. This data set is available on Kaggle, a data science community that provides many data sets and tools, with total images of around 19500, has been split around 15500 into a training set and the remaining into a test set. The Dermnet is a very valuable data set for me to first train my model. After finding the data set, the next step is to preprocess the data to use in training. To train a model, it is very crucial to preprocess the data appropriate to train. For a complex image such as a skin disease, the data set of Dermet is already well cleaned and labeled, here the work we need to do with the images is to resize them into the same shape as 244x244 pixels and normalize all the values of images for further training, this will help to converge the parameter faster. Collecting data for training a machine learning model, particularly for skin disease images, is not an easy challenge. However, the Dermnet dataset significantly facilitates our progress by processing the data we don't need for manual data cleaning and labeling. With this robust training dataset in hand, our next steps involved augmenting the dataset with additional data and fine-tuning model parameters to fit our skin disease classification task.</p>
