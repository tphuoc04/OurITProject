                <article>My name is Tong Thien Phuoc, s4010791. I'm a student at RMIT University Vietnam, My interest in the Computer Science field started when I was just a high school student. I started learning how to program with C. This was a wise choice for me at the very beginning, With C I not only learned to program but also learned how the computer works underneath the hood. With a little knowledge of C programming, I was very excited to find some courses that helped me to build a strong foundation, and CS50 of Prof. David J Manlan appeared to me to get introduced to Computer Science. Along my journey to discover things about technology, I was fascinated by a field of Computer Science which is Artificial Intelligence, due to the great things that computers can do without explicit programs. With my curiosity for Artificial Intelligence particularly machine learning, I have been finding out how a model is built and learning how to build a model from scratch, for example, I can build a machine learning model to classify images with a simple neural network structure. Every time I learn new things, I always discover some new problems, for example After I can successfully train a machine learning model how can I integrate it into an application for the community to use, that is why I want to learn how to make a mobile and web application, and now I have experience at building web, a mobile application that help me a lot to intergrate the machine learning model that I develop. I am very enjoying learning about technology, all the things that I have learned have helped me a lot in my learning journey and given me a good foundation knowledge for this field. I have some experience in building web applications with Reactjs, and machine learning with Tensorflow, and Keras. Now I'm currently a coding teacher at Brightchamps organization. The Ideal Job for me in the future may be an AI engineer position, at this position I can do things about Artificial Intelligence that I love to do.</article>

                <p>The skin issue is quite prevalent, but there are additional unrecognized high predictors as well as a scarcity of dermatologists, general practitioners, and nurses who may need assistance in making the best choices. Plus and save. set out to see if artificial intelligence can come up with a brief list of symptoms that caretakers should take into consideration. By exposing a neural network to 16,114 instances gathered from a remote skin discovery practice, they taught it to anticipate the 26 most prevalent symptoms using deep learning. Each instance is linked to numerous photographs rather than just one, which enables the system to pick up on subtle differences. The accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) predicted outcomes was then compared with 963 cases handled by board-certified dermatologists, general practitioners, and nurses. confirm. The system performed better than primary care doctors (44%) and nurses (40%), giving accurate predictions 66% of the time, matching dermatologists' accuracy rate of 63%. The algorithm's accuracy improved to 90%, beating even that of the skin physicians (75%), when asked to provide an analytical expectation that included the three most likely wants. This tool is accurate regardless of the tale or race because of the range of fields employed in the trainer, both in terms of patient condition and demographics.</p>
                <p>The capacity of a single engine to forecast 26 different states may alter how state data is categorized, even when AI has already been trained to anticipate certain states. By enabling primary care doctors to encourage referrals, this might have a particularly significant impact in remote locations where dermatological patient referrals may be challenging. make a choice. To define instantaneous action, define definition. When the top three ailments listed by the tool have the same standard of care, treatment can start right away. Expect focused follow-up to be feasible in cases when the severity of the first three problems or the suggested therapies vary, giving patients speedy access to the right care. Despite the fact that this device hasn't been given clinical approval.</p>
                <p>We place a lot of emphasis on the data saved in the application while creating dermatoscopy software. The camera system on many modern electronic devices has been enhanced, which has considerably aided the system's comparison and analysis of data warehouses and allowed for the identification of many elements that lead to the victim's skin damage. It is incredibly daunting to be able to acquire and maintain data regarding the knowledge and causes of dermatological illnesses. We have concentrated on processing the memory of the system using a variety of code sequences in order to be able to give comprehensive information on illnesses, and we are grateful for the support of software that continuously downloads and compresses data to aid the memory system. The user is more comfortable since the memory of their gadget just has to consume a small portion of the main gram of memory. Our solutions will work considerably more efficiently for consumers thanks to the augmentation and decompression of all the data, and they won't have to spend as much time trying to figure out what's causing their skin issue right now. by combining various data and contrasting while providing users with realistic outcomes.</p>

                <h2 id="PlanandProgress">3.6 Plan and Proress</h2>
                <p>The idea to build an application that will help people detect skin diseases people suffer from came to me a long time ago. The application aims to help people know about their condition to prevent potential consequences of skin diseases. The motivation for this project is that I realize many people are suffering from skin diseases that could potentially cause harmful impacts on their health, but they are not aware of that. For example, I'm one of them, I suffered from a strange skin disease that caused me a sudden hearing loss in my left ear just because I was not aware of its potential consequences. And this makes me want to make a product to help people, based on the symptoms of the skin application will provide information about the treatment of different conditions, their skin condition, what they suffer from, what it may cause to their health, how to prevent it in the future, and what needs to be aware of. The application helps people to detect their skin condition simply by taking a picture of the suffering skin and algorithms to detect the disease. To make this idea work in code, the power of machine learning came to me, more specifically computer vision, nowadays the rise of AI and its application is in a very wide range in many fields, and utilizing its capability is a great way to improve the performance of our product. To make this easy for people to use and save labor, I think of React Native as the framework we will use to develop an application for many platforms, from iOS to Android OS, this helps people easily download and use on any platform. The plan to develop is divided into two main parts, develop the machine learning model and develop the application to deploy the model in the product.</p>
                <p>The most difficult part is developing the machine learning model. With this, we encountered many problems, such as finding the best approach, collecting data, and preprocessing the data. This is the part that we will spend most of our time on, We had made many changes to our approach before coming to the final decision due to our current ability, and the data set that we can collect. There are multiple parts to developing a model that works well on our given task.</p>
                <p>First, to develop a model that can detect skin conditions precisely our primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying skin disease images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is a neural network architecture that is very effective in image classification, is our best approach. With the help of the community, we can use transfer learning and fine-tuning, a technique that involves taking a pre-trained neural network and replacing the output layer to classify the skin disease image, which means it will be easier and more efficient for the model to learn from data features than learn from scratch. This approach is very effective in our case due to the complexity of our data set which is images of skin, and facilitates our progress in developing the machine learning model. Choosing an architect for our neural network that is large enough to train and effectively classify images is the first part that we have done on our model. With the chosen architecture and transfer learning method this is what we will work on, a pre-trained model VGG-16, a standard CNN architecture with multiple layers. To accomplish this we use Keras, a popular deep-learning library that provides an application interface for loading and using pre-trained models.</p>
                <p>Second, collecting data was the most difficult part that we encountered in the progress of this project. Finding large enough images about skin disease is not an easy task, after finding many resources we luckily found a data set of Dermnet, a free dermatology resource website. This data set is available on Kaggle, a data science community that provides many data sets and tools, with total images of around 19500, has been split around 15500 into a training set and the remaining into a test set. The Dermnet is a very valuable data set for me to first train my model. After finding the data set, the next step is to preprocess the data to use in training. To train a model, it is very crucial to preprocess the data appropriate to train. For a complex image such as a skin disease, the data set of Dermet is already well cleaned and labeled, here the work we need to do with the images is to resize them into the same shape as 244x244 pixels and normalize all the values of images for further training, this will help to converge the parameter faster. Collecting data for training a machine learning model, particularly for skin disease images, is not an easy challenge. However, the Dermnet dataset significantly facilitates our progress by processing the data we don't need for manual data cleaning and labeling. With this robust training dataset in hand, our next steps involved augmenting the dataset with additional data and fine-tuning model parameters to fit our skin disease classification task.</p>               
                <p>After collecting and preparing the data set, now we construct our machine learning model and start to train. I have used the pre-trained model VGG which is provided through Keras API, a deep learning API that is written in Python and constructed by François Chollet. This has accelerated our development process of the model quickly by using transfer learning and fine-tuning methods. But when doing this we realized that we didn't have a data set that was large enough for the model, then we decided to add more data using data augmentation, This is a method in which we use existing pieces of images and modify them for example mirroring, shrinking images to get a new piece of images. Data augmentation is very helpful. This is the stage where we train and evaluate our machine learning algorithm, to see if it is at our expected accuracy or not.</p>
                <p>At this far of the progress, the Machine learning model has been trained and can detect an image of infected skins. Now we need to integrate it into a production. We want our application easy for everyone easy to use and reach, with React Native, an open-source framework to build cross-platform apps created by Meta, we accomplished this just with one source code that helped us to develop both iOS app and Android app so that accelerate our project. Our app helps with a simple UI that can be easily used by everyone, as this far-building app deploys our model into a Flask app for easy use as a side server.</p>
                <p>An application of a machine learning model that can detect skin disease is not new. Our application tries to use the best approach to detect skin diseases that can detect as accurately as humans can. From constructing and training a machine learning model, and building an application that we can integrate our model into to deploy it in the product, We try to make the plan as precisely as how we will do in this project. With many technologies that we will use in this project to facilitate our project, this will make my idea to help people know about their condition become real.</p>

                <h2 id="role">3.7 Role</h2>
                <p>Applications in skin pathology perform a variety of significant functions in the therapy of skin disorders. It begins with compiling and organizing data on symptoms, manifestations, and indicators of skin disorders. This makes it possible to develop thorough patient profiles that provide medical practitioners a thorough picture of the patient's condition. The program makes sure that healthcare professionals have access to the information required to make educated diagnosis and treatment decisions by precisely capturing and classifying this information.</p>
                <p>The program further employs artificial intelligence and picture recognition technologies to automatically scan and check for skin conditions. It can recognize symptoms of skin conditions through picture analysis and use pertinent medical information to deliver diagnostic tools. With this technology-based method, skin diseases may be diagnosed more quickly and accurately, which results in treatment programs that are more successful.</p>
                <p>The skin pathology app is crucial in helping patients get information and assistance. The app offers assistance on daily skin care practices and skin disease prevention, supporting self-care and further proactive management of skin health. it gives information about bacterial species, skin disorders, and related therapies, helping users better understand their condition.When required, the program also makes it easier to connect with dermatologists. It aids in scheduling appointments or transmitting skin images for evaluation by a professional while providing information about the closest dermatologist. Users of this service may get professional advice and do diagnostic tests, ensuring they obtain the most suitable and timely medical interventions.</p>
                <p>Overall, the skin pathology app transforms the treatment of skin illnesses by collecting and organizing data, performing automated disease scans and diagnostics, disseminating knowledge and assistance, and linking users with specialists as needed.</p>

                    We use various libraries for machine learning and software development to help the application progress.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    For machine learning development, we use these:
                    <li>Tensorflow 2.0, Keras libraries, a free and open-source library for machine learning, to build and evaluate machine learning models.</li>
                    <li>OpenCV4, to preprocess the image before feeding it into the algorithms.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    For Application development, we use:
                    <li> React Native, a free and open source for cross-platform development, we used to build the front end of the application for multiple platforms.</li>
                    <li>Express.js, a Node.js web application framework that gives many features for web and mobile development, we use this to build the API and backend for the application.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These libraries are crucial to build and complete the project. to this library, the reason for us to chose it is our team's members have some experience in developing a project with it. Our team used Keras and OpenCV to build, a model that can classify images, with React Native, we used it to build some simple applications, for example, a todo app, and a text app. We want to use these libraries so that we can improve the process of the project and make it more easy to develop and maintain.</p>

                <p>The primary function and aim of our project is to detect skin diseases. To achieve this we need multiple steps and much progress so our goal is to build an application with the main function is detecting skin disease first. Many functionalities were considered when we planned for this project, but due to the limited time, we decided to prioritize the aim that detecting skin disease accurately at first. With many other functionalities, the problem of time may cause many difficulties, especially when developing projects one function may take lots of time to integrate into the product. So to make a perfect app we prioritize our first main function, the User Interface and User Experience of the app, and try to make things perfect in this scope.</p>
