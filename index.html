            <article>My name is Tong Thien Phuoc, s4010791. I'm a student at RMIT University Vietnam, My interest in the Computer Science field started when I was just a high school student. I started learning how to program with C. This was a wise choice for me at the very beginning, With C I not only learned to program but also learned how the computer works underneath the hood. With a little knowledge of C programming, I was very excited to find some courses that helped me to build a strong foundation, and CS50 of Prof. David J Manlan appeared to me to get introduced to Computer Science. Along my journey to discover things about technology, I was fascinated by a field of Computer Science which is Artificial Intelligence, due to the great things that computers can do without explicit programs. With my curiosity for Artificial Intelligence particularly machine learning, I have been finding out how a model is built and learning how to build a model from scratch, for example, I can build a machine learning model to classify images with a simple neural network structure. Every time I learn new things, I always discover some new problems, for example After I can successfully train a machine learning model how can I integrate it into an application for the community to use, that is why I want to learn how to make a mobile and web application, and now I have experience at building web, a mobile application that help me a lot to intergrate the machine learning model that I develop. I am very enjoying learning about technology, all the things that I have learned have helped me a lot in my learning journey and given me a good foundation knowledge for this field. I have some experience in building web applications with Reactjs, and machine learning with Tensorflow, and Keras. Now I'm currently a coding teacher at Brightchamps organization. The Ideal Job for me in the future may be an AI engineer position, at this position I can do things about Artificial Intelligence that I love to do.</article>
            <h3 id="tin">Do Thanh Tin</h3>
            <article>My name: Đỗ Thành Tín. s3970879. I truly like being able to build software or websites that can help people in various ways. The most significant field in which I've shown the greatest interest thus far is artificial intelligence. In addition to learning about the information technology sector, I also pay close attention to health concerns, sports training, and playing sports, such as football, or exchanging new information with others about other facets of life in my free time. John McAfee is the individual whose accomplishments and contribution to humanity as a whole I find to be most impressive. He makes things that are both innovative and cutting edge.</article>

               <p>The idea to build an application that will help people detect skin diseases people suffer from came to me a long time ago. The application aims to help people know about their condition to prevent potential consequences of skin diseases. The motivation for this project is that I realize many people are suffering from skin diseases that could potentially cause harmful impacts on their health, but they are not aware of that. For example, I'm one of them, I suffered from a strange skin disease that caused me a sudden hearing loss in my left ear just because I was not aware of its potential consequences. And this makes me want to make a product to help people, based on the symptoms of the skin application will provide information about the treatment of different conditions, their skin condition, what they suffer from, what it may cause to their health, how to prevent it in the future, and what needs to be aware of. The application helps people to detect their skin condition simply by taking a picture of the suffering skin and algorithms to detect the disease. To make this idea work in code, the power of machine learning came to me, more specifically computer vision, nowadays the rise of AI and its application is in a very wide range in many fields, and utilizing its capability is a great way to improve the performance of our product. To make this easy for people to use and save labor, I think of React Native as the framework we will use to develop an application for many platforms, from iOS to Android OS, this helps people easily download and use on any platform. The plan to develop is divided into two main parts, develop the machine learning model and develop the application to deploy the model in the product.</p>
               <p>The most difficult part is developing the machine learning model. With this, we encountered many problems, such as finding the best approach, collecting data, and preprocessing the data. This is the part that we will spend most of our time on, We had made many changes to our approach before coming to the final decision due to our current ability, and the data set that we can collect. There are multiple parts to developing a model that works well on our given task.</p>
               <p>First, to develop a model that can detect skin conditions precisely our primary goal is to achieve high accuracy in classifying skin disease images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is a neural network architecture that is very effective in image classification, is our best approach. With the help of the community, we can use transfer learning and fine-tuning, a technique that involves taking a pre-trained neural network and replacing the output layer to classify the skin disease image, which means it will be easier and more efficient for the model to learn from data features than learn from scratch. This approach is very effective in our case due to the complexity of our data set which is images of skin, and facilitates our progress in developing the machine learning model. Choosing an architect for our neural network that is large enough to train and effectively classify images is the first part that we have done on our model. With the chosen architecture and transfer learning method this is what we will work on, a pre-trained model VGG-16, a standard CNN architecture with multiple layers. To accomplish this we use Keras, a popular deep-learning library that provides an application interface for loading and using pre-trained models.</p>
